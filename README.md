## Quick info

1. Rebuild of the GastbyJS build using my own webpack config.


## ðŸš€ Quick start on viewing the app

    ```shell
    cd blackswan-tests-webpack/
    yarn build
    ```

    N.B you may need to run `yarn install` or `npm install` first

## ðŸš€ Quick start on developing the app

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and open the `index.html` file in your browser.
    _Note: with more time to play around I would have sorted out hotreloading as well as a little server to run the index.html on a port as this would be required for hotreloading.
